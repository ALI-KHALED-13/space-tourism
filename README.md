# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website challenge

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

the challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


choosing to use a JS-heavy approach, I used a local `data.json` configuration file for the different page data. 


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
